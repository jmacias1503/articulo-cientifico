abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) is a powerful technology that can enhance engineering education by providing immersive and interactive learning experiences. However, many VR studies in engineering education lack a clear theoretical or pedagogical framework to guide their design and evaluation. This scoping review analyzes 51 studies on VR-assisted engineering education and reveals the trends and gaps in the current research. We argue that engineering VR studies should be informed by theories of learning and instruction that address the cognitive and socio-cognitive aspects of learning. We also suggest that VR-assisted engineering education research should incorporate multimedia design and pedagogical principles to optimize the effectiveness of VR applications. Our perspective aims to inspire engineering educators, practitioners, and instructional designers to develop VR contents and formulate VR research imperatives grounded in sound educational theories and multimedia learning principles.}

This systematic review aims to give an overview of the current evidence for the effectiveness of mixed reality use in higher education. By considering the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, the review has examined studies related to university students and explored all aspects of the PICOS model. A broad search of databases like IEEE Xplore, ProQuest, and Scopus was performed, selecting experimental studies published in English from 2017−−2021. PRISMA was chosen as a well-regarded systematic review approach, and the PICO model is specifically aimed at exploring the efficacy of an approach, hence its inclusion. The review includes 12 studies, half randomised control trials and half non-randomised. Quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane Collaboration ROB 2 and the ROBINS-I tools. The majority of these mixed reality studies concentrated more on 3D manipulation, visualisation, and understanding of the 3D object layers and components than procedural learning using HoloLens. Of the selected studies, 53% were in the medical and health sciences, particularly in anatomy, followed by 34% in engineering education, which suggests that these fields are more open to the use of MR for educational purposes than theoretical disciplines such as the humanities and social sciences. Of the 12 studies, nine used augmented reality via head-mounted displays, and five used mobile mixed reality. These studies show that mixed reality has the potential to enhance learning experiences in higher education. Although there are challenges to overcome, MR offers opportunities for innovation in pedagogical practises and curriculum development.}

abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) has gained popularity in education, but its potential in language learning, specifically for teaching a minor language like Maltese, has been understudied. To address this gap, a mixed-methods study was conducted to explore the effectiveness of VR in language learning and identify the advantages and challenges of teaching Maltese as a second language (ML2) with a focus on improving language skills. Qualitative research involved a focus group, while quantitative analysis utilized an online survey with a Likert scale and 25 Maltese teachers as participants. The results revealed that younger respondents were more inclined to believe in the significant impact of VR on improving learning outcomes compared to older respondents. VR was found to effectively engage students in immersive environments and enhance the learning context with entertainment features. However, challenges related to costs, bulky headsets, and technical issues were also uncovered. Although VR tools are not currently utilized in teaching Maltese, this research explored their potential effectiveness in ML2 instruction and provided suggestions for effective integration into language teaching. The findings provide quantitative evidence supporting the effectiveness of VR tools in education and their potential to facilitate ML2 learning. Most participants expressed a positive perception, emphasizing the importance of integrating VR technology into Maltese teaching practices to create more engaging and immersive learning experiences for ML2 learners.}

abstract = {Purpose
This study compares the impact of high-fidelity simulation (HFS) and virtual simulation (VS) experiences on nurses for triaging suspected COVID-19 patients on the basis of their knowledge and skill acquisition.
Background
The essential tools for nurses' professional growth and development are not limited to participation in seminars or symposiums. Training, such as simulation, is also a crucial practice for improving nurses’ competency, especially during a pandemic.
Methods
This study employs a comparative research design. The nurses’ acquired knowledge and skills are evaluated by dividing them into Groups A and B, which are exposed to HFS and VS, respectively.
Results
The mean scores obtained by both groups in their post-tests are significantly higher than that obtained in their pre-tests, by an average of −18.38 for Group A and 22.14 for Group B. The mean scores obtained in their post-Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) is significantly higher than that in their pre-OSCE, by an average of −23.00 for Group A and 20.67 for Group B. Moreover, Group B's mean score in the post-test is significantly higher than Group A's by an average of −3.00. Group A's post-OSCE mean score is significantly higher than Group B's by an average of 2.92.
Conclusions
The professional competence of nurses exposed to HFS and VS improves significantly. Nurses exposed to VS acquire more knowledge, whereas nurses exposed to HFS develop higher-level skills.}

abstract = {While augmented reality (AR) technology is being considered by educators for its potential to help students visualize abstract concepts, currently there are barriers from the high cost of developing complex AR applications. In this study we investigate how the complexity of AR content impacts student learning in remote 1-1 tutoring scenarios, where an instructor uses an AR headset while teaching physics concepts to a remote student. This approach brings the benefits of augmented reality into the already-existing educational practices of 1-1 remote instruction, without requiring AR devices for every student. We present a system for AR-based physics instruction and perform a between-subjects study, measuring how student learning and inquiry behaviors differ between two experimental conditions that vary in the complexity of AR content. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, our results show that students who are tutored with more complex AR content learn better and show a wider variety of inquiry styles. Furthermore, AR visual representations appear to stimulate students to think about a wide range of scientific ideas, to make deeper connections between scientific concepts, and encourage students to have a more active learning style with increased transitions between inquiry activities. We discuss possible reasons and wider implications for these findings.}

After conducting VR-based activities and classroom discussions, 162 elementary school students in South Korea were surveyed. According to Rest's theory, we measured moral sensitivity and moral judgment for the evaluation of moral development of students. The use of this model resulted in a significant improvement in moral sensitivity but no significant difference in moral judgment. This study revealed that, although moral sensitivity can be improved relatively easily through our educational program with VR, a separate educational effort is required to improve moral judgment. In addition, this study is meaningful in that it sheds light on the potential of VR, which is closely related to the technology used in the metaverse.}

However, learning effectiveness was still inconclusive, especially in terms of oral fluency. The insignificant learning outcomes were likely caused by greater cognitive load, equity issues, unpleasant experiences, motion sickness, technology challenges, and lack of instructional activities suited to the Virtual Reality environment. Several strategies to address the challenges of current Virtual Reality platforms identified in the literature review were suggested.}

This study conducted a formative evaluation of an immersive VR expedition application with the aim of understanding users' learning processes and how the application facilitates higher education students' computational thinking skills. Six participants were randomly selected to conduct this evaluation. A mixed research approach consisting of quantitative and qualitative methods was employed. The study quantitatively analyzed users' scores from gameplay to understand how the intervention supported computational thinking skills. Participants were also interviewed to collect data after playing the mini-games to investigate users' experiences. The study showcases players' computational thinking competency, assessed automatically during gameplay. Further, this study used inductive content analysis to demonstrate users' reactions to prototyped VR mini-games. The qualitative findings suggest that users found the VR mini-games interactive and immersive, which provided an opportunity to foster learners' computational thinking skills. The quantitative analysis revealed that student's computational thinking competency can be enhanced through consistent playing of the mini-games. Moreover, the expedition aspect of the VR game stimulated learners' curiosity, which sustained their learning progress. Furthermore, users gained new knowledge and found the mini-games educative. Nevertheless, several aspects of the VR mini-games need improvements, according to users' perceptions. This study contributes to the knowledge in terms of the affordances of VR in education research and provides relevant insights that can shape future studies, for example, the recent hype of metaverse in education.}

abstract = {Authentic learning is an instructional approach that best occurs when the learning activities are set in real-world contexts. The authenticity of the learning experience increases when learning is situated in a context akin to the real world, and realistic learning experiences are created by carefully designing the learning tasks, context, and environment. The fidelity of a learning task's psychological, physical, functional, and social aspects and environment is the design attributes that contribute to the authenticity of the learning experience. The social context, or the social environment during learning, is essential in engaging learners in authentic learning tasks. In this mixed-method study, we investigate whether the collaborative nature of the learning activities, the authentic design of the learning experience and tasks, and the social environment impact the learner's perceptions of their learning experience and confidence in learning transfer. Two instruments were used to collect quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed separately and then together through triangulation. The findings of this study suggest that learners perceived the tasks and environment as realistic and the learning activities' collaborative aspect as helpful. The authentic learning environment did not significantly impact learners' confidence to transfer. However, the experience led to valuable metacognitive reflection and change in self-efficacy beliefs about their learning and practice needs. This experience may result in better self-regulation in long-term learning. This paper presents the findings of this study and discusses future research implications.}
